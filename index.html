      What do you do when you realize a year into your Economics
      Ph.D. that you don't want to spend your life as a researcher?
      You teach yourself to program, of course. After a few years
      as a Business Analyst at Wells Fargo and University of Phoenix,
      and studying programming on the side, I attended a programming bootcamp
      and found a job as a web developer at OneExchange and
      then at Simplifile.

      My first application can be found at
      <a href="https://app.firstclassscouting.org">
        app.firstclassscouting.org</a>. The application tracks
      Boy Scouts for their first set of advancements and makes it
      easy for a scoutmaster to see who is missing which requirements.
      <span class="technical-details">
        Technical details: Mongo database
        hosted on MongoLab, served up from a Node server running Express
        on Heroku, with an Angular 1 frontend using Angular Material
        Design for the layout.

      I enjoy myself most when I get deep into designing user interfaces
      or when I can design a new application from the ground up.
      At Simplifile I make technical and interface design
      decisions for our front-end application. I train others on new
      programming patterns and libraries. I work closely getting our
      interns up to speeed. I wrote a replacement for our selector library
      using functional programming that can display thousands of elements
      with no lag, full keyboard interaction, filtering,
      and dead-simple developer configuration.

      My wife and I adopted our three older boys. Our two youngest
      are the result of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_children">
      snowflake adoptions</a>. I'm happiest when I can take them on
      a hike or a bike ride.
